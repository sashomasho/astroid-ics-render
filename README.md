# astroid-ics-render

A plugin for [Astroid Mail](https://github.com/astroidmail/astroid) to render calendar attachments in the thread view.

## INSTALLATION
Clone the folder or repository of the plugin you want to install to your ~/.config/astroid/plugins/ directory.


## TODO
* Ideally this part of the email should be rendered and also available for clicking to be processed from xdg-open so it can be imported in any calendar app that supports it.
* Some multipart emails can toggle only once between the ICS render and the alternative part with no way to go back.
